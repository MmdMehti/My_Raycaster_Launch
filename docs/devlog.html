    <h3>Raycasting Logic</h3>
    <p>
        Raycasting is a technique that converts a 2D grid-based map into a
        pseudo-3D view by casting rays from the player's position and detecting
        wall intersections.

    <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        One of the biggest challenges was eliminating the fish-eye effect,
        which caused wall distortion. This was solved by correcting the ray
        distance using the player's viewing angle.
